# Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying the Art Leo portfolio to production. The project is decoupled from external site builders—deployment relies on standard Vite static hosting workflows.

## Prerequisites

- Supabase project (for database + auth)
- Domain name (optional)
- Git repository hosting (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

---

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel offers frictionless builds for Vite + React projects.

1. **Push the repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Import the project**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click **Import Project**
   - Select your Git repository

3. **Configure build settings**
   - Framework Preset: **Vite**
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
   - Install Command: `npm install`

4. **Add environment variables**
   Navigate to **Settings → Environment Variables** and add:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
   VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<your-anon-key>
   VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID=<your-project-id>
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click **Deploy**
   - Vercel builds and deploys automatically
   - Access the site at `<project>.vercel.app`

6. **Custom domain (optional)**
   - Settings → Domains
   - Add your domain and follow Vercel’s DNS instructions

### Option 2: Netlify

1. **Connect repository**
   - Visit [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Click **Add new site → Import an existing project**
   - Authorize Git provider and pick the repository

2. **Configure build settings**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

3. **Add environment variables**
   Under **Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment**, add Supabase keys identical to the Vercel example above.

4. **Deploy**
   - Trigger a deploy from the UI or push to the default branch
   - Netlify serves the static build from its CDN

5. **Domain management**
   - Use Netlify DNS or configure external DNS for a custom domain

### Option 3: Static File Hosting (Any CDN)

1. Run `npm run build`
2. Upload the generated `dist/` directory to your preferred static host (Cloudflare Pages, S3 + CloudFront, Render, etc.)
3. Ensure the host serves `index.html` for SPA routes (fallback routing)
4. Set the same Supabase environment variables on the hosting platform

## Post-Deployment Checklist

- ✅ `npm run build` completes without warnings
- ✅ Environment variables are present in production
- ✅ Supabase database and Storage policies permit your domain
- ✅ Lighthouse reports no missing favicon/manifest warnings
- ✅ Error monitoring (Sentry, Logtail, etc.) is connected if required

**Project note:** Art Leo no longer depends on proprietary builder hosting. Deployments mirror standard Vite static site workflows across Vercel, Netlify, and other CDNs.


> Project decoupled from Lovable; no external builder dependencies.
