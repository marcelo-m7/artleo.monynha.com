# Art Leo · Creative Spaces
> **Note:** Project decoupled from Lovable; no external builder dependencies.

Art Leo is a Vite + React portfolio that pairs cinematic motion design with interactive UI patterns. The project showcases background shaders, animated typography, and Supabase-ready data flows that can be extended to power a full digital art showcase.
  
## Features

- ✨ Immersive hero with animated silk background and split text reveal
- 🧭 Responsive gooey navigation with Flowing Menu hand-off on mobile (Infinite Menu has been removed)
- 🖼️ Animated portfolio gallery with search, filtering, and rolling highlight carousel
- 🧱 Stepper-based timeline and typewriter biography for the About page
- 📬 Contact form with toast feedback and safety guards against state updates after unmount
- ♿ Motion-reduced fallbacks across custom React Bits components

## Branding assets

- `/public/brand/logo.svg` – full wordmark with adaptive gradient mark
- `/public/brand/mark.svg` – square monomark for avatars and compact UI
- `/public/favicon.svg` – favicon sourced from the monomark
- `/public/brand/og-image.svg` – share image for social previews

Example usage with Tailwind:

```html
<img src="/brand/logo.svg" class="h-6 md:h-8 text-white" alt="Art Leo" />
```

## Tech stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with custom fluid token scales
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) component primitives
- Animation libraries: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [GSAP](https://gsap.com/)
- React Bits-inspired bespoke components (`SilkBackground`, `FlowingMenu`, `SpotlightCard`, etc.)

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.18 or newer (Node 20 LTS recommended)
- npm 9+ (bundled with recent Node.js releases)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app boots on `http://localhost:5173` by default. Hot Module Reloading (HMR) is enabled out of the box.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

- `npm run build` compiles the project for production.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally for smoke testing.

### Quality checks

```bash
npm run lint
```

Linting ensures TypeScript, React, and accessibility conventions stay consistent.

## Key implementation notes

- **Navigation:** The Infinite Menu experiment has been removed. Mobile navigation now uses `FlowingMenu`, providing consistent hover/touch behaviour with reduced-motion awareness.
- **Motion safeguards:** All animated components check `prefers-reduced-motion`, fall back gracefully, and avoid excessive GPU load.
- **State safety:** The contact form clears pending timeouts during unmount to prevent memory leaks when navigating away mid-submit.
- **Typed data models:** Portfolio listings declare explicit TypeScript types, improving maintainability as the data source evolves.

## Extending the project

- Replace the mock data in `src/pages/Portfolio.tsx` with Supabase queries located in `src/integrations`.
- Update the imagery and copywriting in `src/pages/Home.tsx`, `About.tsx`, and `Contact.tsx` to match your brand voice.
- Explore additional React Bits-inspired components inside `src/components/reactbits/` to enrich future sections.
